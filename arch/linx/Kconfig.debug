	  Enable extremely low-level bring-up instrumentation which writes
	  single-character markers directly to the QEMU LinxISA `virt` UART at
	  0x10000000.

	  This is intended for early boot debugging before the normal console is
	  available. It can be extremely verbose and should be disabled for
	  normal use.
